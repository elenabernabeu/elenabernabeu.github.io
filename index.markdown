I'm Elena, a post-doctoral research fellow with a love for human genetics and health at the **[Institute of Genetics and Cancer](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-genetics-cancer)**, University of Edinburgh, within the **[Marioni group](https://marioni-group.owlstown.net/)**. My current research focuses on the use of multi-omics data to shed light on ageing and Alzheimer's disease. During my PhD, my research centered around the exploration and characterization of sex differences in genetic architecture across the human phenome. 

Beyond research, I'm also passionate about effectively and attractively dissecting complex ideas into understandable concepts, be this for teaching, public engagement or scientific communication purposes. This, together with my love for all things design, has led me to start working as a freelance graphic designer under the alias **[Colored in Science](https://www.behance.net/coloredinscience)**, as well as become an Associate Fellow of the **[Higher Education Academy](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/)**.

Outside work you'll likely find me obsessively scrolling on Pinterest, bingeing a nice thriller or interior design show on Netflix, attempting a random arts and crafts project, napping alongside my cat Orxata, taking pictures of loved ones, or taking long strolls through town or nature with a coffee or bubble tea in hand.  

On this page you'll find some basic info, including contact details, a (hopefully) up-to-date **[CV](cv/)**, and potentially other fun stuff!
