I'm **Elena Bernabeu**, a post-doctoral research fellow at the **[Institute of Genetics and Cancer](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-genetics-cancer)**, University of Edinburgh, within the **[Marioni group](https://marioni-group.owlstown.net/)**. My current research focuses on the use of **multi-omics** data to shed light on **ageing** and Alzheimer's disease. During my PhD, my research centered around the exploration and characterization of **sex differences** in **genetic architecture**.

My research interests lie in **human genetics and health** and **phenotype “programming”** at all molecular levels, looking to exploit omics data sets and large population cohorts to shed light on underlying biological pathways and mechanisms. More specifically, I'm heavily intereted in continuing my research looking into **sex as a biological variable** to promote equality in health and precision medicine, as well as delving into genomic psychiatry, with a focus on **depression and anxiety disorders**.

Beyond the science, I'm also passionate about effectively and attractively dissecting complex ideas into understandable concepts, be this for **teaching**, **public engagement** or **scientific communication purposes**. This has led me to start working as a freelance **graphic designer** under the alias **[Colored in Science](https://www.behance.net/coloredinscience)**, as well as become an Associate Fellow of the **[Higher Education Academy](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/)**. 

On this page you'll find some basic info, including contact details, a (hopefully) up-to-date CV, and potentially other fun stuff!
