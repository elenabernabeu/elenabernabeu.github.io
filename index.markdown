I'm Elena, a research bioinformatician in human genetics at **[Genomics England](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/)**. Previously, I was a post-doc within the **[Marioni group](https://marioni-group.owlstown.net/)**, at the **[Institute of Genetics and Cancer](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-genetics-cancer)**, a part of the **[University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)**, making use of the **[Generation Scotland](https://www.ed.ac.uk/generation-scotland)** cohort to uncover multi-omic associations with ageing and complex traits. During my PhD, I explored and characterized sex differences in genetic architecture across the human phenome in the UK Biobank (check it out **[here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00912-0)**).

I'm passionate about effectively and attractively dissecting complex ideas into understandable concepts, be this for teaching, public engagement, or scientific communication purposes. This, together with my love for all things design, has led me to start working as a freelance graphic designer under the alias **[Colored In Science](https://www.behance.net/coloredinscience)**, as well as become an Associate Fellow of the **[Higher Education Academy](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/)**.

Outside work you'll likely find me obsessively scrolling on Pinterest, bingeing a nice thriller or interior design show on Netflix, attempting a random arts and crafts project, napping alongside my cat Orxata, taking pictures of loved ones, or taking long strolls through town or nature with a coffee or bubble tea in hand.  

On this page you'll find some basic info, including contact details, a (hopefully) up-to-date **[CV](cv/)**, and potentially other fun stuff!
